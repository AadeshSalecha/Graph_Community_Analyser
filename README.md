This project contains IGraph and NetworkX implementations of the following repo:
https://github.com/BhavtoshRath/l1_community_ops

It also contains the latest implementations for TSM calculation based on:
https://github.com/BhavtoshRath/TSM_python

The following functionality is not working as of 7.27.19:
a) second_level stats for IGraph implementation

b) spreader_role stats for both NetworkX and IGraph implementaion

c) Igraph implementation for bel_ranks is working (but needs to be validated against ground truth)
